<h2 id="1-purpose">1. Purpose</h2>
<p>A primary goal of lostnyc-dev is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>We invite all those who participate in lostnyc-dev to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

<li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>
<h2 id="5-reporting-guidelines">5. Reporting Guidelines</h2>
<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Email: hello.patrickw@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>
<h2 id="6-addressing-grievances">6. Addressing Grievances</h2>
<p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify hello.patrickw@gmail.com with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>

<p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.</p>
<p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.</p>
